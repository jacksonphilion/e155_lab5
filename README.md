Brief Description
This repository contains the code for Lab 5 of E155 at Harvey Mudd College, taught by Prof Josh Brake. The full write-up may be found on my portfolio website here: https://jacksonphilion.github.io/hmc-e155-portfolio/labs/lab5/lab5.html

Structure
The `source` folder contains all custom libraries and the main.c file

The `SEGGER` folder contains the main project, executable on SEGGER. Note that my code expects this file structure in order to properly include all files in the preprocessor.

The `notesAndExtras` folder contains any additional notes, images, etc
